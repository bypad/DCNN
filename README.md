# Regression with Deep Learning

DATA: Create our dataset. Replicate an example from MATLAB that tries to regress the angle at which an image of a number has been rotated. To do this, we need a few functions to generate a rotated verison of the data.

# ResNet

Neural networks can be put together in lots of different ways. The topology of the network controls how information flows through the networks - and how gradients flow backwards. This example will look at ResNet style networks, which use residual blocks and allows for deeper, yet smaller (in terms of number of parameters), networks.

# VGG

The DCNNs in the literature, simply relied on stacking layers one on top of the other, with up to a few convoluations followed by a max-pooling operation to reduce the resolution, and then a repeat of this until a sufficient number of layers was reached. More layers was seen as better, as it allowed for richer and richer representations. However, after a while performance stops improving, and can in fact go backwards.
